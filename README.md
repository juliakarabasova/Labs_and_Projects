Files description in chronological order (newest >>> oldest):

## **[Object Detection](Object_Detection_Karabasova.ipynb)**

Analyze and teach several models (mostly Faster-RCNN) to recognize fruits

    Libraries used: torch, torchvision

## **[Image Classification](Image_Classification_Lab.ipynb)**

Analyze and teach several different neural networks (convoluional, fully-connected) to recognize hand-written letters; 
also using BatchNorm, GroupNorm, and fine-tuning pretrained models

    Libraries used: torch, torchvision, sklearn

## **[NLP projects](nlp/)**

Analyze small texts, sentences and a rather small dataset of film reviews (text generation with vectorizing dataset - bag of words, tf-idf)
Also work with golos dataset for STT (speach to text) model (QuarzNet by NeMo)

    Libraries used: nemo.collections.asr, spacy, nltk, pymorphy, pymystem, yargy, sklearn.feature_extraction.text, gensim.models

Analyze a dataset of students from two schools in Portugal: data preprocessing, regressions, binary classification, multiclass classification

    Libraries used: pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, numpy, sklearn (LinearRegression, Ridge, Lasso, KNeighborsRegressor, 
    RandomForestRegressor, DecisionTreeRegressor, RandomizedSearchCV, LogisticRegression, KNeighborsClassifier, 
    RandomForestClassifier), xgboost

## **[Telegram Chat Bot (team work of 3 people)](telegram_chat_bot/)**
