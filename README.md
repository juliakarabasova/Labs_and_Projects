# Labs and Projects
Files description in chronological order (newest >>> oldest):

## **Object Detection** *[in progress]*

Analyze and teach several models (Faster-RCNN, RetinaNet, SSD) to recognize fruits

    Libraries used: torch, torchvision

## **Image Classification**

Analyze and teach several different neural networks (convoluional, fully-connected) to recognize hand-written letters; 
also using BatchNorm, GroupNorm, and fine-tuning pretrained models

    Libraries used: torch, torchvision, sklearn

## **NLP projects**

Analyze small texts, sentences and a rather small dataset of film reviews (text generation with vectorizing dataset - bag of words, tf-idf)
Also work with golos dataset for STT (speach to text) model (QuarzNet by NeMo)

    Libraries used: nemo.collections.asr, spacy, nltk, pymorphy, pymystem, yargy, sklearn.feature_extraction.text, gensim.models

## **Supervised Learning**

Analyze a dataset of students from two schools in Portugal: data preprocessing, regressions, binary classification, multiclass classification

    Libraries used: pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, numpy, sklearn (LinearRegression, Ridge, Lasso, KNeighborsRegressor, 
    RandomForestRegressor, DecisionTreeRegressor, RandomizedSearchCV, LogisticRegression, KNeighborsClassifier, 
    RandomForestClassifier), xgboost

## **Telegram Chat Bot (team work of 3 people)**

Create unique telegram chat bot: work with telegram library, make requests from sites, logging, database with pymongo, test (80% coverage)

    Libraries used: logging, requests, csv, pymongo, unittest, unittest.mock, mongomock

## **Clustering**

Analyze a dataset of various US cities: data preprocessing, hierarchical clustering, DBSCAN, kmeans, plotting (including 3D plots)

    Libraries used: pandas, sklearn (.cluster, .metrics), seaborn, matplotlib

## **Exploratory Analysis**

Analyze a dataset of students from two schools in Portugal: build graphics, analyze data types, make conclusions

    Libraries used: pandas, seaborn, matplotlib
